# 🧠 Interpretable Home Credit Risk

This project builds a transparent and explainable credit risk model using the **Home Credit Default Risk dataset**. It is designed to help lenders assess loan applicants with limited credit history—combining machine learning accuracy with **regulator-friendly interpretability** through SHAP and Tableau dashboards.

> 📊 **Live Dashboard**: [Loan Default Risk Analysis (Tableau Public)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saayed.alam/viz/LoanDefaultRiskAnalysisModelResultsSHAPMetrics/0-Overview)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a machine learning pipeline that:
- Predicts the **probability of loan default** using LightGBM
- Explains individual and global model decisions using **SHAP**
- Translates results into **interactive, stakeholder-friendly Tableau dashboards**

---

## 📌 Key Results & Highlights

- 🔍 Achieved clear **SHAP-based interpretability** for all predictions  
- 🧮 Final model: **LightGBM with Optuna tuning**, threshold = 0.30  
- 🧠 Global & local insights transformed into **5 core Tableau visualizations**  
- ✅ Structured outputs for **auditors, risk managers, and product teams**

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard Overview

The following CSV exports power a full Tableau Public dashboard:

| 🔢 Visualization                   | 📁 CSV Export                             | Description                                |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SHAP Global Importance            | `global_shap_importance.csv`              | Top features by global SHAP impact         |
| Score Distribution by Label       | `risk_distribution.csv`                   | Predicted score distribution by outcome    |
| SHAP by Risk Band                 | `agg_shap_by_risk_band.csv`               | Feature impact segmented by risk group     |
